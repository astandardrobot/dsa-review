/*
 * A jump search is similar to binary searches and interpolation searches: they're good for sorted arrays.
 * Where a jump search gets ahead over a linear search is that it uses intervals to iterate through the array.
     * Letâ€™s consider the following array: (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610). The length of the array is 16. 
     * The Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assming that the block size to be jumped is 4. 
        STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4; 
        STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8; 
        STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 12; 
        STEP 4: Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55, we will jump back a step to come to index 8. 
        STEP 5: Perform a linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.
